# NPVecchia

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of NPVecchia is to provide users with scalable GP covariance estimation without assuming its form. It provides some of the barebones functionality to accompany an upcoming paper with Dr. Katzfuss. The C++ implementation was specifically done for this package, as was a lot of formatting, functionality, and error checking improvements.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("the-kidd17/NPVecchia")
